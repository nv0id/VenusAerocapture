# Numerical Modelling of Aerocapture for a Scientific Mission to Venus

Modelling Techniques 2 project as part of 2nd year mechanical engineering degree.

## Abstract

> The task was to model a spacecraft entering the atmosphere of Venus using aerocapture, and find the insertion height needed to reach a 1200km apoapsis. To do this, MATLAB was used to modify pre-existing code and create new functions, such as a shooting method. The model created was able to return a value of 1329.074km, which met all the necessary requirements. Functionality was added to help understand the fuel burn needed at the apoapsis to circularise the orbit, and an interface was incorporated to increase the user interaction and allow editing if any conditions changed. Some understanding of the heating and drag effects was also needed to ensure the validity of the model and where limitations lay.
